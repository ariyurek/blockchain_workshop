# Blockchain Workshop

This repository holds all stuff for my workshop related to Ethereum and Solidity based smart contracts

## Getting Started

- Install Geth as it is specified in the Github page
- For Solidity development, I prefer Visual Studio Code with Solidity extension

## Agenda

* [0.ethereum] - Setup a private Ethereum network using Geth and observe the mechanics of Blockchain
* [1.helloworld] - Simplest smart contract :)
* [2.fibonacci] - Basics of Solidity
* [3.helloweb] - Communication between a web page and an Ethereum node with Web3
